# About

Who is this, Pixelpickle Games?

Look. Where do I start? We make game, mostly! We also create animations and do interactive projects to help fund those games we mostly make. A few years back Lylian: Paranoid friendship was released.

Currently, a ridiculously overambitious project is taking shape which we initially called 'Burden'. The name lived up to its name way to well and so now renamed to Company Colossal. Which is awesome.
