Company Colossal is many things. It's epic! It's funny! It's a hybrid tower defense shoot'em'up! it's not finished.

With Character designs created by the talented [Alex Alexovich][0] who has worked on things like Invader Zim and Serenity Rose. And the voice over talent, [G.K Bowes][1] - Marvel vs Capcom, Minecraft Story Mode - an award for best characters is sure to come, surely.

Keep your eyes peeled and comfortably lubricated for news to be popping up soon-ish.
