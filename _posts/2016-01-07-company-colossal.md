# Company Colossal

Company Colossal is many things. It's epic! It's funny! It's a hybrid tower defense shoot'em'up! it's not finished.

With Character designs created by the talented [Aaron Alexovich][0] who has worked on things like Invader Zim and Serenity Rose. And the voice over talent, [G.K Bowes][1] - Marvel vs Capcom, Minecraft Story Mode - an award for best characters is sure to come, surely.

In preparation for imminent war against the Good siblings' militia, a small band of reckless heroes must escort colossal machines to orchestrate the ultimate retaliation. In doing so, they have a lot of fun, get into a lot of trouble, and save worlds.

Keep your eyes peeled and comfortably lubricated for news to be popping up soon-ish.

Currently at 30 levels varying between tower defense and shoot'em'up, there's even a couple of other genres in there, because... storyline!
